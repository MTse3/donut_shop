This program generates the number of donuts a Top Pot franchise would need to make per hour.
The number of donuts per hour depends on the franchise location's minimum and maximum customers per hour, along with the average donuts each customer purchases.
To simulate how many customers come in and buy donuts, a random number is generated inbetween the min and max per hour.
After logging on to the table how many donuts are needed per a given hour, a total for the day is given.
All Top Pot Donut locatons were expected to be open from 7AM to 6PM.
5-19: Added ability to input data for a new location and populate the table with random projections

Worked with Kalani and Marcel, also help from Nick, and David.
